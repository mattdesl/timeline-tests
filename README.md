# brief

The end goal is generic timelines that are not application- or environment-specific. For example, one dev may hook a timeline up to a 3D scene to control the camera rotation (using quaternions and spherical interpolation), another might hook the timeline up to animate CSS properties, or another might be using something else entirely.
